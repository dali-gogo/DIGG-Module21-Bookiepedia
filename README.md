# DIGG-Module21-Bookiepedia
Dalia Gomez - Module 21 Challenge: Bookiepedia

## Description
Starter code was used to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app considers the use of the MERN stack, a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to save book searches to the back end.
